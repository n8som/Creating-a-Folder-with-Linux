# Creating-a-Folder-with-Linux

In the Google IT Support course I learned how to SSH into a Linux Virtual machine and create a basic folder using the command line. They had us use Quicklabs to access the VM, but I figured out how to create a VM using Microsoft Azure and SSH into the machine using its public IP address. 

To create a folder you would use the command "mkdir". I entered the command "mkdir my-super-cool-folder" into the terminal and it created the folder.
